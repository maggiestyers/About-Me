The Endangered Languages Project (ELP) was created in June of 2012 to save languages after the last native speaker passes. Languages can be lost due to oppression and injustice. Preserving these languages preserves the cultural identity, values, and heritage. [Google.org](https://www.google.org) teamed up with [First Peoples’ Cultural Council](http://www.fpcc.ca), [Eastern Michigan University](https://www.emich.edu), and [the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa’s Linguistics Department](http://ling.hawaii.edu) to attempt to save at-risk languages. The ELP strives to research and document endangered languages to protect them. Information can be submitted to the ELP website via text, audio, links, or video files. With knowledge of language made up-to-date and accessible, the goal is for no language or culture to be forgotten.

The ELP website is very simple to navigate. The cover page is colorful and catches the eye, but it is not cluttered. There’s a short and to-the-point video that highlights the goal of the ELP. The separated eight research categories are displayed for easy access and the link for submissions is obvious. There is also a link to download the database spreadsheet. Under the Language link, every language option is listed in alphabetical order. Going farther into the website gets a little more complex. 

Each language on the extensive list opens a link to all of the variations available. The language map is an interactive map that displays all at risk languages labeled with a color by how endangered they are. Clicking each dot shows roughly how many speakers there are and the resources available. The technology on the ELP website runs very smoothly and is an excellent tool for any kind of research.

For one to submit information, they do not have to be an invited member of ELP. Allowing anyone to aid the project provides much more opportunity for language to be added. A team will review and verify the submissions. However, occasionally the review process is so in-depth that useful information is lost. There’s also a blog option that viewers can subscribe to and submit to. The blog keeps the conversation going and reminds why it is important. The best way to save a language is to keep people talking about it.

This project should aim to appeal to everyone in order to save all language. College professors and students are resources for the ELP and use it as a resource. The ELP has much to offer to those doing research on a culture or language for a project of their own. Those learning a new language can also benefit greatly from the information on this website. There are also many forms of sign language available on the ELP.

The project is currently managed and funded by [First Peoples' Cultural Council](http://www.fpcc.ca) and the [Endangered Languages Catalogue/Endangered Languages Project (ELCat/ELP)](http://ling.hawaii.edu/research-current/projects/elcat/) team at University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in coordination with the Governance Council. The interactive website was designed and developed with the help of [Exygy](https://exygy.com) and [Vizzuality](https://www.vizzuality.com). Their mission is to save all remaining languages and this efficent website contributes greatly to their success.
