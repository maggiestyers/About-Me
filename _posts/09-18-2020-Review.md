The Endangered Languages Project (ELP) was created to save languages after the last native speaker passes. Languages can be lost die to oppression and injustice. Preserving these languages preserves the cultural identity, values, and heritage. [Google.org](https://www.google.org) teamed up with [First Peoples’ Cultural Council](http://www.fpcc.ca), [Eastern Michigan University](https://www.emich.edu), and [the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa’s Linguistics Department](http://ling.hawaii.edu) to attempt to save at-risk languages. The ELP strives to research and document endangered languages to protect them. Users of the ELP website can submit information via text, audio, links, or video files. With knowledge of language made accessible, the goal is for no language or culture to be forgotten.
