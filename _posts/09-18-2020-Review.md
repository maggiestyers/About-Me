The Endangered Languages Project (ELP) was created in June of 2012 to save languages after the last native speaker passes. Languages can be lost die to oppression and injustice. Preserving these languages preserves the cultural identity, values, and heritage. [Google.org](https://www.google.org) teamed up with [First Peoples’ Cultural Council](http://www.fpcc.ca), [Eastern Michigan University](https://www.emich.edu), and [the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa’s Linguistics Department](http://ling.hawaii.edu) to attempt to save at-risk languages. The ELP strives to research and document endangered languages to protect them. Information can be submitted to the ELP website via text, audio, links, or video files. With knowledge of language made up-to-date and accessible, the goal is for no language or culture to be forgotten.

The ELP website is very simple to navigate. The cover page is colorful and catches the eye, but it is not cluttered. There’s a short and to-the-point video that highlights the goal of the ELP. The separated eight research categories are displayed for easy access and the link for submissions is obvious. Under the Language link, every language option is listed in alphabetical order. Going farther into the website gets a little more complex.

For one to submit information, they do not have to be an invited member of ELP. Allowing anyone to aid the project provides much more opportunity for language to be added. A team will review and verify the submissions. However, occasionally the review process is so in-depth that useful information is lost.
