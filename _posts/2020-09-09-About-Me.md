## Hello! My name is Maggie Styers
![Me and Ash](https://github.com/maggiestyers/About-Me/blob/master/Images/MeAndAsh.jpg?raw=true)

I am a third-year student at Christopher Newport University. I’m majoring in English with a writing concentration and a minor in Women and Gender studies. I am graduating a year early and plan to get a master’s degree in Library Science. My long-term goal is to work at a library in a populated area and write at the same time.

I read a lot and am a part of several book clubs. I’ve volunteered at my local and my school library. I used to review books on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). I'm currently the president of the [CNU SPCA Club](https://www.instagram.com/cnuspcaclub/). 

I’m from Richmond, Virginia but plan to go out of state for Graduate school. I have two dogs, four cats, two rabbits, six chickens, and a betta fish. I work at a dog kennel called [Wingmont Stables and Kennels](https://wingmont.com). I wrote my first book when I was five years old. It was titled Eggs with Legs and was based on my pet chickens. It won second place at the [state fair](https://www.statefairva.org).
