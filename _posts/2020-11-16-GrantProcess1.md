I remember reading E. Lockhart's *We Were Liars* for the first time when I was a junior in high school. *We Were Liars* is a poetic and mesmerizing young adult novel following Cady Sinclair. The story takes place on Beechwood Island, and is told out of chronological order. Cady is experiencing migraines and memory loss from a trauma she cannot remember and no one will explain to her.

This novel has won several awards including ALA Top Fiction for Young Adults in 2015. Examining and publishing novels that tackle issues such as PTSD and depression is extremely important and should be encouraged. Young adults who also have experienced these should have someone to relate to in the books they read. According to Jodi Rodriguez from Scholastic, the benefits of seeing themselves in a book are that it helps to inspire and create an impact, provide a mirror to identity, and allow for connections to be built. 

I know that when I finished this novel for the first time, I needed someone to talk to about it. It was captivating and left me so unsettled that I needed to discuss it. Unfortunately, no one that I knew at the time had read this book and I am sure that others have felt the same way. Using WordPress, I want to create a companion website to the novel. This interactive website would include a complete and detailed map of the Sinclair family plot, Beechwood Island. So many locations on that island are important to the story and I believe that bringing it to life would aid the novel. 

I also want to remap the story in a sense. We Were Liars is told out of order and the past is only revealed as Cady slowly regains her memory. I understand why the story is told this way, but I think readers would benefit from having the option to see it chronologically after they finish the novel. I could take each section and organize it by when it occurred, even if Cady doesnâ€™t remember it that way. 

Research has certianly been interesting. While there aren't any projects dedicated to *We Were Liars*, there are projects created about other YA Books. I have been getting ideas from those example projects about which direction I want to take this project. Looking at similar projects also encourages my confidence that mapping projects such as these are important.

I really like the NYC Subway Method by Gabriela Pereira (pictured below) as a mapping tactic. I think it's an organized way of mapping the story chronologically, while including every big event. I've been doing a lot of research on it and it seems clean and easy to understand. This model of The Hunger Games is very similar to the kind of mapping that I want to do.

There's a lot to think about with a project like this, but I think *We Were Liars* is a perfect novel to choose for such a project. I still think that this is a great project for me, even as I go deeper. The story is captivating and really sticks with you. It tackles a lot of issues that other Young Adult books avoid. Having a companion website to such a revered novel will enhance the reading experience.
