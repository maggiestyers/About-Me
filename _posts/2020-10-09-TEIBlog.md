# TEI Review
---
I worked on column one of page 653 of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" by Charlotte Perkins Stenson. After looking over my page, I was a little nervous, but it did not look too complicating, so I was excited to get to work. Our class used Google Docs to markup our assigned text. Each person was assigned a page based off of first name. Google Docs is a familiar program and I think that that made the process easier for me. We looked for notable occurrences such as new paragraphs, dashes, page breaks, italicized words, misspellings, and quotes. My section had quite a few dashes, but that was the most complex aspect I had to markup. We simply added a comment whenever we noticed something besides like regular wording and punctuation.

After editing the Google Doc, we made the transition Oxygen, a much more challenging software than GitHub. Oxygen allowed us to code our section of the text following XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and more specifically, TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). There was a lot more coding involved with Oxygen compared to Github so at first it was really intimidating. On Github, all of the lines start at the same place, compared to working with Oxygen where they are spaced at various tabbed over points depending on the code. All of the new coding and symbols were really overwhelming at first.

Luckily for me, my section of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" was very simple to markup and then code. The most complicating occurrence I had to work with were dashes, which were not hard at all. Another benefit to working on this piece was the red or green box in Oxygen that displayed whether or not the user's code was successful. However, for me, I think that the most helpful thing was working through the beginning of the process the step by step in class. I'm not sure I would have been able to follow written directions, so walking through it in class and asking questions was very beneficial to my comprehension.

I somehow damaged my Oxygen file at some point by trying to rename it, and it would not open, so I had to completely start over. At that point, I kind of already had the hang of coding so it was pretty easy to get caught back up from memory. I was also able to refer to the recorded class if I needed to. Now I know not to rename the file after taking it out of Oxygen because my Macbook will get confused. 

I couldn't fit everything into the screenshots, but the sleek final look of Oxygen is so appealing! This project was not as difficult as I'd anticipated, just like Dr. Stover said, and I had fun with it. I definitely still have a lot to learn about Oxygen and coding in general but I'm very excited to work with it more to expand my understanding. I think that the knowledge of using programs like these will translate into other classes and perhaps even my future career.
