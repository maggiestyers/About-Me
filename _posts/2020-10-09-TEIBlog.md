# TEI Review
---
I worked on column one of page 653 of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" by Charlotte Perkins Stenson. To start, our class used Google Docs to markup our assigned text. Google Docs is a familiar program and I think that that made the process easier for me. We looked for notable occurances such as new paragraphs, dashes, page breaks, italisized words, misspellings, and quotes. My section had quite a few dashes, but that was the most complex aspect I had to markup. We simply added a comment whenever we noticed something besides like regular wording and punctuation. 

After editing the Google Doc, we made the transition Oxygen, a much more challenging software than GitHub. Oxygen allowed us to code our section of the text following XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and more specifically, TEI (Text Encoding Initiative).
