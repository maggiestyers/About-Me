# TEI Review
---
I worked on column one of page 653 of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" by Charlotte Perkins Stenson. To start, our class used Google Docs to markup our assigned text. Google Docs is a familiar program and I think that that made the process easier for me. We looked for notable occurances such as new paragraphs, dashes, page breaks, italisized words, misspellings, and quotes. My section had quite a few dashes, but that was the most complex aspect I had to markup. We simply added a comment whenever we noticed something besides like regular wording and punctuation. 

After editing the Google Doc, we made the transition Oxygen, a much more challenging software than GitHub. Oxygen allowed us to code our section of the text following XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and more specifically, TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). There was a lot more coding involved with Oxygen compared to Github so at first it was really intimidating.

Luckily for me, my section of "The Yellow Wall-Paper" was very simple to markup and then code. The most complicating occurance I had to work with were dashes. Another benefit to working on this piece was the red or green box in Oxygen that displayed whether or not the usse's code was successful. However, for me, I think that the most helpful thing was working through the begining of the process the step by step in class. I'm not sure I would have been able to follow written directions, so walking through it in class and asking questions was very beneficial to my understanding.

I couldn't fit everything into either screenshot, but the sleek look of Oxygen is so appealing! I'm very excited to work with it more and continue learning.
